* Abstract
A way for me (and friends who also frequent the same gym) to book my workouts on a VERY GREAT pre-90s website that doesn't support renewable appointments.

* Configuration
A configuration file "*config.json*" is needed in order to schedule the days you want to book on.

Here's an example configuration file:

#+begin_src json
{
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "dates": ["2016-04-26T18:09:16Z", "2016-04-26T18:09:16Z", "2016-04-26T18:09:16Z"]
}
#+end_src

* Docker
The preferable way is to use Docker:

#+begin_src bash
docker build -t chrome .
docker run chrome
#+end_src

* Usage
If running this locally, do the following:

#+begin_src bash
npm install
npm run book
#+end_src
